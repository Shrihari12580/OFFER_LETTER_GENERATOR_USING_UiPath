# Offer Letter Generator Using UiPath 

# Description :
The goal of this project is to use UiPath to automate the process of creating offer letters for recently hired applicants. First, an Excel file containing the information of several candidates is read by the automation. Candidates who have been marked as employed are filtered away by the bot. It uses a pre-existing Word document template that is saved on the system for each of these candidates, updating it dynamically with the candidate's name, job title, joining date, and salary. Following the creation of the personalized offer letter, the bot generates an email for each hired applicant, attaches the relevant offer letter, and sends the email along with a confirmation that the candidate has been employed. The HR onboarding process now requires a lot less manual labour thanks to this technology and ensures timely communication with new hires.
